  <p1>My name is Oscar Ascione I was born and raised in Darwin, Northern Territory Australia. I did all my schooling in Darwin at the Essington School Darwin. Before studying at RMIT, I went to a university called SAE at the start of 2020 studying film, I attended this university for a full week and realised this was not the course for me. Throughout high school, I did a lot of acting through the school system and attending acting classes out of school at a youth group called Corrugated Iron. I acted in an advertisement called ‘Speeding There’s No Future In it’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYnMLysyjaw">(Link to Advertisement)</a>, I was in it for a solid 3 seconds in which I was fishing off a rocks edge. Furthermore, I have acted in some short films for my friend, Thomas Midena, they are called Dark Utopa and the Sketch Files 5. </p1>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>I use Information Technology as a creative outlet to tinker with game mods and use it to fulfill the creative bones in my body. I once downloaded a bunch of mods for a game called Borderlands 2, the point of the mods were to completely randomise the type of weapons that were dropped and the enemies that spawned, meaning you could get a end game enemy to spawn in the early game or the best weapon to be dropped by a basic mob. The fun part of this was tinkering with the code to make all these mods compatible with each other. All though creating the mods from scratch was out of my expertise, just small tinkering with the code and actually making the mods work together gave me such as great satisfaction knowing a made all these components come together.</p>
    <p>My interest IT began when I played my first PC game called Garry’s Mod when I was 12 after watching my brother play it. He then later bought it for so we could play together. Garry’s mod is a started out as a mod for half life 2 and was later developed into a full fledged game. Garry’s mod is a host of community run servers for a plethora of game modes that are made and managed by the community. My friends and I started working on our own Garry’s mod server, it never came to fruition, but we would download player models, mods and weapons. Then we would write the code to insert these entities into the server. It was very basic coding but it is what drew me to IT none the less.</p>

<img src = cs.png width= 50%>
    <p>The ideal job that I am currently trying to achieve is a cyber security analyst. This job assessing cyber attacks and creating a protocol and policy to reduce the chances of cyber security breaches within an organisation. Furthermore, it would incorporate skills to identify any weaknesses in a company’s network that could possibly lead to a security threat. The job is a constant learning experience as you have to be constantly keeping up with the current and upcoming cyber-attacks that have threatened other organisations and companies, then develop countermeasures from these experiences.  This job is very ideal for me because it places you in an ever growing environment that constantly has new challenges to overcome with a strong team. Teamwork and communication skills are necessary to be successful in this type of work which is what truly draws me to it.</p>
    <p>This job requires a knowledge of previous major cyber security threats and breaches that have happened throughout history. University qualifications that are required are bachelors degree in Information Technology or computer science, or related fields. Other qualifications that can be acquired are becoming a certified ethical hacker, certified information system security professional and other certification in the relevant field.  I have researched previous breaches throughout history to understand to understand current reasoning by policies that have been established in major companies. An example is many companies do not allow the employees to bring USB’s from outside the office because it only takes a hacker to drop some USBS in the parking lot that contain malicious code to corrupt a network.
    </p>
    <p>To achieve getting this type of job I will need to research and understand the complexities of different types of viruses that have been used to conduct cyber-attacks. 	I must also finish getting a bachelor of Information Technology. I must begin to  work toward becoming a certified ethical hacker, a lot of jobs prefer employees with this certificate. I believe a major leap into the right direction would be try work experience in this field during my third year of university, this will allow me to actually witness professionals in the workplace and learn practical skills that are used in the field everyday.	</p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p> My project idea is an app that allows the user to learn and memorise lines for monologues, speeches and presentation. What separates this idea from similar apps is that it allows the user to voice recognition to grasp errors they are making in their speech, and as well it allows the user to personalise their learning experience using a variety of different learning methods that best suites the user. </p>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>Almost every person in the modern day will face the ordeal of presenting a speech in front of an audience. It may be a middle school project in front of a class, business proposition to a board or a monologue in front of a packed-out theatre, the stress of presenting should be made a bit easier with the aid from the modern day guidebook, a phone app. The market for this kind of app is massive, as it effects basically all age and gender demographics. Most similar apps can have easier alternatives such as voice memos for aural learners and simply a notepad or learning cards for those visual learners. There is no other app that uses voice recognition to assist memorisation.</p>
  <p></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This app is designed to assist users with the task of learning and memorising words for speeches, plays, presentations and any activity that requires the memorisation of words. The main feature of this application that separates it from similar apps is that it uses voice recognition to aid you in the memorisation of a text. Specifically, the user will insert the text they want to memorise, once inserted, they record themselves without the original text as a prompt, then this recording is then converted into text and compared with the speech inserted, depicting to the user mistakes. These mistakes can be missing lines, incorrect words and words that were not articulated properly or were mumbled. The results can be given as percentile value based on how accurate the user was compared to the original text they inserted and with errors clearly highlighted.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, before the user uses the voice recognition portion of learning they can participate in many other learning styles for memorisation. Such as recording themselves performing a text and then listening to it back for those who prefer to learn through aural methods. User can also learn visually, once the text has been inputted into the application, the first line of the text will appear and once the user has read it the text disappears, the user then can speak the line and then they will be prompted if the spoke the line correctly. If they are correct another line will then be added, they will read both lines and the process will continue. But if they are wrong the must repeat the lines until they are correct. Users can personalise these options, for example if they are doing a Shakespeare monologue in which the lines have to be 100% correct, it will allow the user not to go to the next line unless they are completely correct. But if they are doing a presentation in which the lines can accuracy is not of up most importance, it will allow the user to continue to the next line. As well, the app can take into account of synonyms of words. For example if the line is “The book was good” and the user says “The book was great”, this will not be considered a mistake if requested by the user. </p>
    <p>The program will allow multiple user work together from 1 device. If the users a learning lines for a play it will allow the lines to be split amongst the characters. Then the users can go over the lines together using the voice recognition feature, it will tell the users which lines are correct and any errors made. </p>
    <p> The app will collate data on previous attempts at learning the text, it will the convey to the user any mistake patterns that are consistently occurring in their learning process. That may be a certain line they keep forgetting or a word that they consistently change. </p>
    <p>The app has the potential to be a database that allows users to upload video or audio files of them performing their text. It can allow feedback from other users and allow users to compare their own performances. If the user is learning a Shakespeare monologue, they have access to other users’ interpretations of the monologue. It creates a communal environment where people can learn from each other, not just by themselves. </p>
      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>There are many open-source voice recognition software available to the public such as Project Deepspeech, Kaldi and Leon. Many of these program’s API supports code such as C, Python and Java. The most likely software to be chosen is Deepspeech as it can support multiple platforms for its development, some include Windows, Linus and MacOS.
A coding language has to be chosen for development for the app, the code the will most likely be chosen is python since that is what is being taught in the Introduction to Programming course in the Bachelor of Information Technology degree at RMIT.
An app development software could be used to minimise coding for creating the personalisation and template of the app. Software include Appery.io and Appy Pie.
</p>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        <p>Skills that are required to develop this app, is a proficiency in coding for app development. These skills can be gained via online platforms such as Scrimba and Code Academy that aim to teach people how to code through a multitude of tasks and classes. As well as a understanding of the process of voice recognition and implementing the open source code into an application. Furthermore, the ability to analyse data collated on the topic of memorisation to implement the best learning solutions for specific users. </p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>If this project is successful it will create a resource where people can effectively learn and memorise a particular text that they must present to an audience. It will allow the user to not reinforce bad habits such as consistently forgetting a line or replacing particular words as the app compares results from previous attempts.  Overall, this app can really help people who struggle with learning speeches, monologues and any piece that requires memorisation.</p>
